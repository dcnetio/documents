# Validators and Candidates

Validators in the DC network act as blockchain validation nodes responsible for verifying transactions and blocks, thus ensuring the security of the entire network. To become validators, nodes must receive adequate staking support. These validators earn income from transaction fees and receive a portion of the blockchain rewards for each period. However, they also face the risk of asset forfeiture if they fail to perform their duties correctly. Additionally, validators have the opportunity to generate revenue as cloud service space providers.

Candidates in the DC network are nodes that compete to become validators but have not yet qualified. The status of candidates and validators is not fixed; their identities may change each period, primarily based on the number of staking tokens they receive at the end of each period.
