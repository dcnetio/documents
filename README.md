# What is DC

Decentralized Cloud (DC), also known as Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), represents a significant shift from traditional cloud computing. Unlike the centralized nature of conventional clouds, DC operates without a central authority and is not controlled by any single individual or institution. This structure allows anyone to participate by running nodes anywhere, which automatically network with each other.

One of the core features of DC is the use of blockchain technology to provide consensus services. This enables each node in the network to independently offer cloud computing services while also serving as backups for other nodes. This decentralized approach ensures that DC is not merely a single cloud or a collection of clouds, but a comprehensive cloud network.

DC offers a full-stack ecosystem that includes various layers such as the incentive layer (consensus), network layer, persistence layer (storage), and application layer (computing). This structure provides developers with a familiar environment similar to traditional internet development, but with the capabilities to create decentralized applications (DApps).

The user experience of DApps built on the DC platform is designed to be as intuitive and seamless as using conventional internet applications. This approach not only simplifies the transition for developers but also ensures that end-users can easily adapt to the new decentralized environment. Overall, DC provides a highly convenient and efficient decentralized network infrastructure for developing and deploying applications.
