# DApp Development Practices

Developers can create DApps using on-chain smart contracts with DC, similar to traditional blockchain projects. However, DC's real innovation lies in enabling the development of DApps based on DCNode, which enhances performance, user experience, and business applicability beyond what traditional internet applications offer. Developers can select from the following methods based on their specific business needs:

#### 1. **Development Based on DC Client SDK**

To simplify the development process, DC offers a comprehensive toolchain that includes SDKs supporting multiple programming languages for both mobile and PC platforms, along with a Docker-based development environment. This approach allows developers to leverage their existing development skills and technology stack to quickly build DApps, without requiring in-depth knowledge of blockchain technology.

#### 2. **Development Based on DC Entry Application**

DC provides a standalone entry application, akin to a Web3.0 wallet application, which offers basic wallet functionalities. Its primary feature, however, is to serve as a deployment and runtime environment for lightweight applications. Through this entry application, any lightweight application developed using H5 or Python can implement decentralized data storage and facilitate light user interactions. This application allows for one-click publishing of new applications, fostering innovation among users and enabling widespread participation in application development and customization. This capability is particularly relevant in the evolving AI era, as it meets the growing demand for personalized user experiences.

#### 3. **Development Based on DC's RPC Services**

DC also offers RPC interfaces that are similar to those found in centralized cloud services. Developers can use these interfaces to access DCNode and deliver services. This method offers greater flexibility but requires developers to have a comprehensive understanding of decentralized technologies and the full operational framework of DC.

These development approaches provided by DC not only cater to different levels of technical expertise and application needs but also encourage a broader participation in the decentralized application landscape, enhancing the capabilities and reach of DApps in various sectors.
