# Data Storage

DC (Decentralized Cloud) employs a comprehensive and secure file storage mechanism that integrates various protocols and technologies to ensure data integrity, security, and availability. Here are the key components of DC's data storage mechanism:

**1. Data Storage and Transmission Mechanism**

* **IPFS Protocol**: DC utilizes the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient data transfer and storage. IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. It allows for decentralized storage and sharing of data across a network of nodes.

**2. Data Storage Location Index**

* **DCChain Indexing**: The binding relationship between user data storage information and their PeerId is recorded on DCChain. This blockchain-based indexing facilitates the rapid retrieval of data, enhancing the efficiency of data access within the decentralized network.

**3. Data Storage Backup Mechanism**

* **Redundancy**: To ensure data reliability and availability, DC ensures that user-uploaded data is backed up in at least three copies. For more critical data, such as user account information, at least five copies are maintained across different nodes.

**4. Storage Permission Control Mechanism**

* **Ownership-Based Management**: DC manages data access based on ownership, ensuring that data can only be manipulated by users who have sovereignty over it. This mechanism prevents unauthorized access and manipulation of data.

**5. Data Security Check Mechanism**

* **Integrity Monitoring**: Each DCNode actively monitors the data stored on it. If any data is found to be tampered with or damaged, the node automatically notifies the network and initiates a task to restore the data from backups, ensuring the integrity and consistency of data across the network.

**6. Data Encryption Mechanism**

* **Data Sovereignty and Encryption**: All sensitive data within DC is encrypted, making it invisible and inaccessible to anyone except the user who owns the data. This encryption ensures the privacy and security of user data against external breaches and internal vulnerabilities.

**7. Controllable Data Storage Location**

* **User-Specified Storage**: Users have the option to specify the location of their data storage within the network. This feature allows users to store their data on trusted nodes, enhancing the security and reliability of the stored data.

**8. Data Deletion Mechanism**

* **Data Sovereignty and Deletion**: Users can delete their data at any time, which ensures data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations. This mechanism is crucial for users who wish to maintain control over their data lifecycle.

**9. Controllable Number of Backups**

* **Customizable Redundancy**: DC allows users to individually increase the number of backups for important files. This flexibility helps users enhance the security and availability of critical data based on their specific needs and concerns.

These mechanisms collectively ensure a robust, secure, and user-centric data storage environment in DC, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance data security and decentralization.
